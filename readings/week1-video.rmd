## Millenium: The Art of Living (Video)
- Dogon of Mali
- they carry the dead up to a tomb
  - throw what they used to carry him from a high place
  - bring the shroud down to lie in his house
- always carry the death blanket your whole life
  - only use it as a shroud when you die
- after the deceased is in the tomb
  - dance around with the blanket
  - firing guns
  - playing music
- they all gather around and thank the deceased
- the whole affair takes several nights of dancing, chanting, speaking
  - on the third night they sing a song of mourning
- ancestors become bushes
- wear masks and dance to reconnect with ancestors in the bush
  - masks are animal/tree themed
  - life vs death
  - the idea is to make life win by dancing and celebrating
