# Introduction

## Buddhist Parable of the Mustard Seed
- begins with a commentary on **reincarnation**
  - "flowing-on for a hundred thousand ages"
  - "evolved in this Buddha-era among gods and men"
  - **cosmological claim**
- Gotami-tissa
  - poor family
  - "skinny Gotami"
- Gotami has a son
  - people respect her now
  - **son dies**
    - this **drives her crazy**
    - "sorrow-to-the-point-of-madness"
    - she still feels attached to the body
- she desperately carries the body around
  - begs for medicine for her dead son
  - people revile her but she does not understand
- finally, a wise man tells her to **ask the Buddha for "medicine"**
 
### What Sort of Medicine is the Man Talking About?
- **advice/teaching** rather than physical medicine
- in fact, the Buddha tells her:
  - go to a house where they have not experienced death
  - ask them for a mustard seed
- Gotami searches for a family who has not experienced death
  - she cannot find one
  - so what use are their mustard seeds?
- finally she realizes the **futility of her madness**
  - death is a fact of life

## Wari Mortuary Cannibalism

## Religious Ritual (Characteristics)
- rituals
  - **invariant**
  - tied into **understanding** of an overall act
- religious rituals
  - **embedded in cultural systems**
  - performed
    - real audience
      - marriage
      - funeral
    - imagined audience
      - prayer
  - formalistic
    - **rules-governed**
  - traditionalistic
    - **invariant**
    - not that it **doesn't change**
    - rather that it **appears not to change**
- ritualization **posits the existence of** an **authoritative reality**
  - this reality **dictates the immediate situation**

### Effects of Ritual
- forms/**reinforces communities**
- connect actions with **authoritative reality**
- experiential and performative explanation of social realities
  - reverence of elders in Chinese religion
  - at a funeral, the youngest descendent acts as the deceased for a day
    - they get to experience reverence for the day

### Van Gennep's Rite of Passage
- involve a **change of social status**
  - e.g., Bar Mitzvah
- three stages
  1. **separation**
     - taken out of every day situation
     - separated from typical social circumstances
  1. **liminality**
     - between two different states
     - e.g., both boy and man at once
     - individuality is limited
  1. **reintegration**
     - often with special signs of having completed ritual
       - e.g., wedding rings


## Various Definitions of "Death"

### Traditional
- cessation of breath

### Chinese Culture
- Iron Crutch Li
- the dead were left out and venerated for a period of time
  - perhaps like Iron Crutch Li they were just visiting the gods

### Harvard
- a person can be declared dead IF
  - **brain function** is **irreversibly lost**
  - even though heart/lung activity is present due to **mechanical support**
- **brain death**

### Veatch's Four Possibilities
1. irreversible loss of the **flow of vital fluids**
1. irreversible **loss of soul**
1. irreversible **loss of brain function**
   - including self-regulation (involuntary function)
1. **loss of capacity for social function** due to **loss of higher brain function**

## Issues with Comparative Study of Religion
- there are *certain* cases for which this might be okay
  - keep it objective
  - focus on specific comparison/contrast
    - how does a given religion handle death?

### E.B. Tyler
- **primitive cultures**
  - somewhat pejorative
  - can one culture be more primitive than another?
  - inferior to another?

### Essentialism
- the assumption that there is **one original religion** from which **all others branch**
- **no evidence for this whatsoever**
